# Slabify

This is a WorldPainter plugin designed to add slab and stair detail to terrain.

## Possibilities

Currently, the following is supported:

* Automatic slab placement on terrain
* Automatic stair placement on terrain, either via interpolation, an existing heightmap, or through a neural network.
* Associate the layer with a material, or otherwise specify a "mapping."

## Usage

Place the .jar into the WorldPainter plugins folder. On Windows, this would be %AppData%/Roaming/WorldPainter/plugins.

## Note

**This plugin is still under development.** If a bug occurs, please contact me through Discord or create an issue.
